### Setting up project

* Install [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html)
    - Go to project root directory and enter
    - `sbt` to load the sbt console
    - `test` to run tests from sbt console or `sbt test` directly
    - `run` to start server from sbt console or `sbt run` directly

* [Disabled] For [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/install), include the SuperSafe Community Edition Scala compiler plugin, which will flag errors in your ScalaTest (and Scalactic) code at compile time, by first adding this line to ~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt:
  ```
  resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"
    ```
