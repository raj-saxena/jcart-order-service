### Setting up project

* For [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/install), include the SuperSafe Community Edition Scala compiler plugin, which will flag errors in your ScalaTest (and Scalactic) code at compile time, by first adding this line to ~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt:
  ```
  resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"
    ```
